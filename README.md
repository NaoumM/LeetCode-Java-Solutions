LeetCode-Java-Solutions
=======================

Part of the solutions for the LeetCode problems in Java:

30 out of 173 as of Jan. 6th, 2015.

42 out of 175 as of Jan. 27th, 2015.

280 out of 297 as of Dec. 5th, 2015.

306 out of 317 as of Feb. 21st, 2016.

File names that start with a three digit number are solutions in my second session. The three digit number is the problem number in LeetCode. 

The solutions serve as a self record. Various optimizations can be done in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and code cleanness.

Other files are solutions in my first session, which were done before the early 2015. Rest of the solutions in the first session were not uploaded.
